# einfache-mathe-schule
Thanks to Miriam Balbi, during math class I get to put the topic we have right now into code.

I am a 15 jears old programmer and I really love what I do because it opens up a world of opportunities. With programming,
I can build apps, create games, develop websites, automate tasks, analyze data, and so much more. The possibilities are limitless, 
limited only by my imagination.
